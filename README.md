# What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?

    I found it very easy to develop the server side implementation with Node.js as it is well integrated with MongoDB. The       routing functions & framework helped me in developing the logic quickly.It helped in handling HTTP method of the request     such as GET, PUT, POST etc and also router level middleware calls easily.
    
# What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

    After knowing and working on the languages I chose to develop the project, I found it really easy to develop this. So I
    actually did not find any aspect of this implementation hard.
    
# If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?

    If I were to use these technologies professionally, i would like to use them very much because these have great usability     and ease for developing web applications. As a matter of fact i woudn't be thinking of the biggesst concerns not to be       using these technologies since they are so developed and framed to meet all the requirements of any project.
